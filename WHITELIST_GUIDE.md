# ✅ Whitelist Management Guide

## What is the Whitelist?

The whitelist is a security feature that gives you **complete control** over which phone numbers receive automatic AI responses. Only numbers on your whitelist will get auto-replies.

## How It Works

### ✅ Whitelisted Numbers
- Automatically receive AI responses
- No manual approval needed
- Instant replies based on your settings

### 🚫 Non-Whitelisted Numbers
- Messages are logged but **NOT auto-replied**
- Show up in "Pending Approval" section
- You can manually approve and add them to whitelist
- Once approved, they get automatic responses

## Using the Whitelist System

### Access Whitelist Page

1. Open admin panel: http://localhost:3000
2. Click **"✅ Whitelist"** in the sidebar
3. View all whitelisted numbers and pending messages

### Add a Number to Whitelist

**Method 1: Manual Add**
1. Go to Whitelist page
2. Click **"➕ Add Number"**
3. Enter phone number (with country code, e.g., +628112656869)
4. Optionally add name and notes
5. Click **"✅ Add to Whitelist"**

**Method 2: Approve from Pending**
1. Go to Whitelist page
2. Look at "Pending Approval" section
3. See messages from non-whitelisted numbers
4. Click **"✅ Approve & Add to Whitelist"** next to any number
5. Add name/notes (optional)
6. Number is instantly whitelisted!

### Remove a Number

1. Go to Whitelist page
2. Find the number in the table
3. Click **"🗑️ Remove"**
4. Confirm removal
5. Number will no longer receive auto-replies

### View Pending Messages

All messages from **non-whitelisted numbers** appear in the "Pending Approval" section:
- See who messaged you
- View their messages
- Approve them with one click
- Messages stay logged for your review

## Current Whitelist Status

✅ **Active Numbers**: 1

## Testing Results

**Result**: ✅ **Auto-replied successfully!**

```
✅ Number +628112656869 is whitelisted. Processing auto-reply...
✅ Grok AI response received

```

### 🚫 Non-Whitelisted Number Test
**Number**: +1234567890

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Trusted Numbers
- Add your own numbers first
- Add known contacts
- Test before adding customer numbers

### 2. Review Pending Messages Daily
- Check who's trying to reach you
- Approve legitimate contacts
- Block spam by not whitelisting

### 3. Use Notes for Organization
- Add person's name
- Note where you met them
- Track approval date
- Add any relevant context

### 4. Regular Cleanup
- Remove numbers you no longer need
- Keep whitelist updated
- Review periodically

## Security Benefits

1. **Prevent Spam**: Only approved numbers get responses
2. **Control Costs**: Limit AI API usage to known contacts
3. **Privacy**: Choose who can interact with your AI
4. **Quality Control**: Review messages before auto-responding
5. **Flexibility**: Easy to add/remove numbers anytime

## API Endpoints

If you want to integrate programmatically:

```bash
# Get all whitelisted numbers
curl http://localhost:3000/api/whitelist

# Add a number
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/whitelist \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone_number": "+1234567890", "name": "John", "notes": "Customer"}'

# Remove a number
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/whitelist/+1234567890

# Check if number is whitelisted
curl http://localhost:3000/api/whitelist/check/+1234567890
```

## Troubleshooting

### Number not getting auto-replies?
1. Check if number is on whitelist
2. Verify auto-reply is enabled in Settings
3. Check active hours settings
4. View server logs for errors

### Can't add a number?

### Pending messages not showing?
- Refresh the page
- Check Message History for all messages
